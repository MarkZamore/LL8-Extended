"""Fetches the files that are too large to live in git, straight into the pack.

GitHub refuses a file over 100 MB, and Cobblemon is 123 MB; a 65 MB resource
pack would be committed twice over, once in the tree and once as an overlay
source. Such a file is not committed at all: tools/remote-files.json says where
it lives and what its SHA-256 must be, this fetches it before anything reads
those folders, and a file whose hash does not match is deleted rather than
used. So the pack still ships one exact copy to every player - the guarantee
just comes from the hash instead of from git holding the bytes.

Stdlib only, no arguments needed:

    python tools/fetch_remote_files.py [--check]

--check verifies what is already on disk and downloads nothing; it exits 1 if
anything is missing, which is how a local checkout learns it needs a fetch.

Exit codes: 0 everything present and correct, 1 a file is missing or wrong,
2 the list itself is unreadable.
